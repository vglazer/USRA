# Accurate Monotone Splines

## Overview
MATLAB rountines for accurate 
[monotone cubic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotone_cubic_interpolation) 
spline interpolants, based on a
[paper](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19910011517.pdf) by Hung T. Huynh.
The main monotone spline functions are [here](https://github.com/vglazer/USRA/tree/master/interpolation/hermite).
Miscellaneous functions for computing convergence rates and the like are 
[here](https://github.com/vglazer/USRA/tree/master/interpolation/ccc).

The following 
[report](https://github.com/vglazer/USRA/blob/master/interpolation/reports/report.pdf) shows errors and convergence 
rates for cubic spline interpolants across a variety of monotonicity 
constraints. 

This work was performed under the supervision of
