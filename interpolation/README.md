# Accurate Monotone Splines

## Overview
[MATLAB rountines](https://github.com/vglazer/USRA/tree/master/interpolation/hermite) for accurate 
[monotone cubic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotone_cubic_interpolation) 
spline interpolants, based on this
[paper](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19910011517.pdf) by Hung T. Huynh.
