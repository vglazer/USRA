Some 
[combinatorial designs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_design) 
lack algebraic structure and require constructive proofs
to settle existence. The problem can be reduced to finding vertex-induced
subgraphs with a prescribed edge count in various flavors of graphs. We
provide a suite of efficient 
[stochastic local search](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283825846_Stochastic_Local_Search_Algorithms_An_Overview) 
algorithms for doing so, based on 
[Tabu search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabu_search) 
and implemented in C. See report for details
