# NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Awards
The Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) has an 
Undergraduate Student Research Award Program (USRA) that pays a 
student to do four months of research with a professor over the summer. This 
is a competitive process: the Computer Science department gives out about 
a dozen awards each year. See 
[this page](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~campbell/usra/usra.html) for more
details.

I was selected two years in a row:
* 2002: [Finding vertex-induced subgraphs using Stochastic Local Search](https://github.com/vglazer/USRA/tree/master/subgraph_finding)
* 2003: [Monotonicity-preserving Cubic and Quintic Splines](https://github.com/vglazer/USRA/tree/master/interpolation)
