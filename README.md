# NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Awards
The Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) has an Undergraduate Student Research Award Program (USRA) that pays a student to do 16 weeks of research with a professor over the summer. This is a competitive process: the computer science department has approximately 15 awards to give this year. More background [here](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~campbell/usra/usra.html)
