# NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Awards
The Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) has an 
Undergraduate Student Research Award Program (USRA) that pays a 
student to do 16 weeks of research with a professor over the summer. This 
is a competitive process: the computer science department has approximately 
**15 awards** to give each year. See 
[this page](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~campbell/usra/usra.html) for more
background.

I was selected two years in a row:
* 2002: [MATLAB rountines for accurate, monotonicity-preserving cubic and quintic interpolation](https://github.com/vglazer/USRA/tree/master/interpolation) 
* 2003: [randomised restricted local search to find vertex-induced subgraphs with a prescribed edge count](https://github.com/vglazer/USRA/tree/master/subgraph_finding)
